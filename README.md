Advent of Code Solutions in Rust
================================

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming challenges, written in the Rust programming language. I'm using Advent of Code as a fun and engaging way to learn Rust and improve my problem-solving skills.

Getting Started
---------------

These instructions will help you set up the project and run the solutions on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

To run the solutions, you'll need to have Rust and Cargo installed. If you haven't already, follow the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install the Rust toolchain.

### Running the Solutions

1.  Clone the repository:
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anis00723/advent-of-code.git
    cd advent-of-code
    ```
    
2.  Navigate to the directory for a specific challenge (e.g., `day01`):
    
    bash
    
    ```bash
    cd 2022/day01
    ```
    
3.  Run the solution using Cargo:
    
    arduino
    
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```
    
    This command will compile the code and run the solution for the specified challenge.
    

Contributing
------------

I'm using this repository to learn Rust, so I'm not actively seeking contributions. However, if you have suggestions for improvements or want to discuss the solutions, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
